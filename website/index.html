            <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is Solar Power?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity,
                either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination.
                Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area
                of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the
                photovoltaic effect.

                Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized
                applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid
                rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. As the
                cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the
                millions and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an
                inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest
                photovoltaic power station in the world is the Pavagada Solar Park, Karnataka, India with a generation
                capacity of 2050 MW. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">History of Solar Energy</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge
                from light exposure was first observed by Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel.

                Though these initial solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used
                as an instrument to measure light.

                The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when Willoughby Smith discovered that
                the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium. After this discovery, William Grylls Adams and
                Richard Evans Day published "The action of light on selenium" in 1876, describing the experiment they
                used to replicate Smith's results.

                In 1881, Charles Fritts created the first commercial solar panel, which was reported by Fritts as
                "continuous, constant and of considerable force not only by exposure to sunlight but also to dim,
                diffused daylight." However, these solar panels were very inefficient, especially compared to
                coal-fired power plants.

                In 1939, Russell Ohl created the solar cell design that is used in many modern solar panels. He patented
                his design in 1941.

                In 1954, this design was first used by Bell Labs to create the first commercially viable silicon solar
                cell. In 1957, Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal
                oxidation at Bell Labs. The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell
                efficiency.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Solar power in India is a fast developing industry as part of the
                renewable energy in India. The country's solar installed capacity was 44.3 GW as of 31 August 2021.

                The Indian government had an initial target of 20 GW capacity for 2022, which was achieved four years
                ahead of schedule. In 2015 the target was raised to 100 GW of solar capacity (including 40 GW from
                rooftop solar) by 2022, targeting an investment of US$100 billion. India has established nearly 42
                solar parks to make land available to the promoters of solar plants. The Ministry of New and Renewable
                Energy had stated that a further 36.03 GW (as of January 31, 2021) of solar projects are under various
                stages of implementation and 23.87 GW are in the tendering process.

                Rooftop solar power accounts for 2.1 GW, of which 70% is industrial or commercial. In addition to its
                large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) initiative, India is developing off-grid solar power
                for local energy needs. Solar products have increasingly helped to meet rural needs; by the end of
                2015 just under one million solar lanterns were sold in the country, reducing the need for kerosene.
                That year, 118,700 solar home lighting systems were installed and 46,655 solar street lighting
                installations were provided under a national program; Just over 1.4 million solar cookers were
                distributed in India.

                The International Solar Alliance (ISA), proposed by India as a founder member, is headquartered in
                India. India has also put forward the concept of "One Sun One World One Grid" and "World Solar Bank" to
                harness abundant solar power on global scale.</p>
